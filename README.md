##  Civic Reporting App
🏙️ Overview
The Civic Reporting App is a mobile application built using React Native and Expo Go that empowers citizens to report civic issues such as potholes, garbage accumulation, water leakage, or broken streetlights in their locality — instantly and effortlessly.

When a user submits an issue, the app automatically captures their live location (latitude and longitude) and allows them to upload an image and add a description.
A dashboard view displays all reported issues, helping authorities or developers visualize and manage them efficiently.
